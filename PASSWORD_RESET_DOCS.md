# Password Reset Feature Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the password reset functionality implemented in the MindNest Flutter app. The feature provides a secure, user-friendly way for users to reset their passwords using email verification.

## Features
- ✅ Modern, intuitive UI with step-by-step progress indicator
- ✅ Email masking for privacy (e.g., `exam***@gmail.com`)
- ✅ OTP (One-Time Password) verification via email
- ✅ Real-time validation and error handling
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing login flow
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## User Flow

### Step 1: Email Input
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on the login screen
2. User enters their email address
3. Email validation ensures proper format
4. User clicks "Send Reset Code"
5. System sends OTP to user's email via Supabase

### Step 2: OTP Verification & Password Reset
1. User receives OTP via email
2. Email is displayed in masked format for privacy
3. User enters the 6-digit OTP code
4. User enters new password (minimum 6 characters)
5. User confirms new password
6. System verifies OTP and updates password
7. Success message displayed, user redirected to login

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- `lib/screens/password_reset_screen.dart` - Main password reset screen
- `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` - Added "Forgot Password?" navigation
- `test/password_reset_test.dart` - Unit tests for validation logic

### Key Components

#### `PasswordResetScreen`
- **State Management**: Uses enum `ResetState` to track flow steps
- **Email Masking**: `maskEmail()` function provides privacy protection
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation for email and password fields
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Supabase Integration
- `resetPasswordForEmail()` - Sends OTP to user's email
- `verifyOTP()` - Verifies the OTP code with type `OtpType.recovery`
- `updateUser()` - Updates the user's password after verification

### Security Features
- OTP expiration handled by Supabase
- Password minimum length requirement (6 characters)
- Email validation with regex
- Secure password reset flow prevents unauthorized access
- Context validation (`mounted` checks) prevents memory leaks

## UI/UX Highlights

### Design Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Two-step process to avoid overwhelming users
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress indicator shows current step
- **Privacy-First**: Email masking protects user privacy
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors, clear labels, adequate touch targets

### Color Scheme
- Primary Color: `#8B7CF6` (Purple)
- Background: White with subtle gray containers
- Error States: Red `#DC2626`
- Success States: Green `#059669`

### Responsive Elements
- Floating action buttons with proper sizing
- Input fields with adequate padding
- Clear visual hierarchy with typography
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`test/password_reset_test.dart`)
- ✅ Email masking function validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Password confirmation matching

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate from login to password reset
- [ ] Submit empty email (should show error)
- [ ] Submit invalid email format (should show error)
- [ ] Submit valid email (should advance to OTP step)
- [ ] Email masking displays correctly
- [ ] OTP validation works
- [ ] Password requirements enforced
- [ ] Password confirmation matching
- [ ] Successful password reset flow
- [ ] Return to login after success

## Integration with Existing App

### No Breaking Changes
- ✅ Existing login functionality unchanged
- ✅ All current features remain functional
- ✅ Backward compatible implementation

### Dependencies Used
- `supabase_flutter` - For authentication and password reset
- `flutter/material.dart` - For UI components
- Existing `page_transitions.dart` utilities

## Configuration

### Supabase Setup Requirements
1. **Email Templates**: Ensure Supabase project has password reset email template configured
2. **SMTP Settings**: Configure email delivery settings in Supabase dashboard
3. **Redirect URLs**: Set up redirect URL for mobile app (currently: `mindnest://reset-password`)

### Environment Variables
- Supabase URL: `https://yqhgsmrtxgfjuljazoie.supabase.co`
- Supabase Anon Key: Configured in main.dart

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] SMS-based OTP as alternative to email
- [ ] Social login integration for password reset
- [ ] Password strength indicator with visual feedback
- [ ] Custom email templates with app branding
- [ ] Rate limiting for password reset requests
- [ ] Multi-language support for error messages

### Analytics Integration
- [ ] Track password reset completion rates
- [ ] Monitor common error scenarios
- [ ] User journey optimization based on data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **OTP not received**: Check email spam folder, verify SMTP configuration
2. **Invalid OTP**: Ensure code is entered within expiration time
3. **Network errors**: Handle gracefully with retry mechanism
4. **Email format errors**: Improved regex validation implemented

### Error Messages
- Clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios
- Success confirmation with automatic navigation
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions

## Conclusion
The password reset feature provides a secure, user-friendly way for users to regain access to their accounts. The implementation follows security best practices while maintaining an excellent user experience with modern UI design and smooth animations.
