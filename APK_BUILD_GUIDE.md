```

### Step 2: Configure Gradle Signing
Create `android/key.properties`:
```
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=mindnest
storeFile=../mindnest-key.jks
```

### Step 3: Update build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
