# MindNest
MindNest is a mobile application designed to make mental health support more accessible, personalized, and consistent. It bridges the gap between patients and therapists by combining secure real-time consultations with intelligent digital tools that extend care beyond therapy sessions. The platform encourages continuous self-reflection, structured treatment management, and early detection of emotional distress helping individuals take better control of their mental well-being.
# Core Features 
MindNest has been carefully structured to address the real challenges faced in mental health care by blending secure communication, continuous support, and therapist insights. Each feature is designed not only to provide functionality but also to create a seamless and safe environment for both patients and therapists.
## User Registration & Authentication
MindNest provides a secure registration process where patients and therapists create their accounts. Access is role-based, ensuring that each user only interacts with the features designed for them. The authentication system uses encrypted credentials, keeping personal information safe while making login simple through methods like email or OTP. This strong security foundation protects sensitive mental health data and builds trust from the very first interaction.
## Therapist Panel
Therapists are provided with a personalized panel that serves as their central workspace. Within this dashboard, they can manage profiles, review appointment schedules, and track patient progress. The panel also highlights insights drawn from patient journals, sentiment patterns, and treatment adherence, allowing therapists to understand their patients beyond scheduled sessions. Exportable reports make it easier to keep professional records up to date while reducing manual effort.
## Appointment Scheduling
MindNest includes a built-in scheduling system where patients can view therapist availability and book sessions without hassle. The system synchronizes appointments across patient and therapist dashboards and automatically sends notifications to prevent missed meetings. Rescheduling is straightforward, making therapy more flexible and consistent. By simplifying this process, the app minimizes scheduling conflicts that often disrupt traditional therapy.
## Real-Time Video Consultation
Therapy sessions in MindNest are conducted through encrypted one-to-one video calls, ensuring privacy and confidentiality at every stage. The integration of WebRTC technology enables high-quality streaming that adapts to different internet speeds, offering smooth and reliable communication. This feature removes geographic barriers, allowing patients and therapists to connect regardless of distance, while maintaining the intimacy of face-to-face interaction.
## In-App Chat Communication
Between sessions, patients can use the in-app chat system to stay in touch with their therapists. This secure channel supports ongoing conversations, whether to share progress, ask questions, or express concerns in the moment. All exchanges remain available for reference, giving both patients and therapists a continuous thread of communication that strengthens engagement and makes therapy feel present even outside scheduled appointments.
## Treatment Plan Management & Personalized Reminders
Therapists can assign structured treatment plans within the app, including activities, exercises, or self-care practices tailored to each patient. To ensure consistency, patients receive timely reminders for these tasks, as well as for medications, journaling, and upcoming sessions. The system monitors adherence and provides visibility into how closely patients are following their plans, which helps therapists evaluate effectiveness and adjust recommendations when necessary.
## Crisis Support Tools
Recognizing that critical moments can arise outside scheduled therapy, MindNest integrates crisis support mechanisms. The app can detect signs of extreme distress within journals or chat entries and immediately provide resources such as emergency helplines and quick access to personal emergency contacts. With user consent, therapists can also be notified when high-risk signals are identified. While not a substitute for emergency services, this feature ensures users are not left unsupported during vulnerable situations.
## Payment & Billing Management
To simplify the administrative side of therapy, MindNest includes a transparent billing system. Patients can view consultation fees before booking sessions, make secure payments directly within the app, and review their billing history with ease. For therapists, the dashboard tracks earnings and payment statuses, reducing the need for external systems and allowing them to focus more on patient care.
## Location & Activity Tracking
As an optional feature, MindNest allows patients to share activity levels or check-ins that give therapists additional context about their routines and behaviors outside therapy. With full user consent, this information helps identify patterns such as social withdrawal or lifestyle changes that may be linked to mental health. While entirely optional, it provides therapists with a more holistic view of their patientsâ€™ well-being.
